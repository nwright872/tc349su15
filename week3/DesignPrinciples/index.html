			<h1>PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN</h1>
		</header>
		<h2>Perception: Affordance</h2>
			<img src="photos/Screenshot(67).png" alt="affordance">
			<p>The easiest representation of affordance here, are the icons in the top right. The icon envelope gives off the affordance of email and the mapping pin gives off the affordance of location </p>
		<h2>Learning: Singal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
			<img src="photos/Screenshot(70).png" alt="s/n">
			<p>Here is a great example of a high S/N ratio. Only important content is shown. The animation is a secondary or complement to the main content and does not get in the way.</p>
		<h2>Usability: Hick's Law</h2>
			<img src="photos/Screenshot(68).png" alt="hicks">
			<p>We see Hick's Law here through the simple two sections at the top of the page. you see "animation" and "interactive" (two simple choices you can make in a second).</p>
		<h2>Appeal: Rule of Thirds</h2>
			<img src="photos/Screenshot(72).png" alt="thirds">
			<p>This is a great example of using the "rule of thirds" grid to layout information. A large title link and a large image is drawn to split up the page into 3 sctions.</p>
		<h2>Decisions: Modularity</h2>
			<img src="photos/Screenshot(66).png" alt="modularity">
			<p>We have a nice idea of modularity with this right-side nav bar. this site is broken up into nice chunks and section that are easily digestable.</p>
