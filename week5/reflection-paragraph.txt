I chose the second version of my tile page. This one reflected a more colorful design, with the the different colors, I was able to block off my different sections of my one page site with the different colors. The first version tile I created was more thematically geared towards a Watchmen esque color sequence. I am happy with the second version over this one because of its brightness and good vibes it carries through.
